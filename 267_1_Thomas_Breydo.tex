\begin{problem*}
Suppose $T\in\SL(\C^4)$ is such that the eigenvalues of $T$ are
3, 5, 8. Prove that $(T-3I)^2(T-5I)^2(T-8I)^2=0.$
\end{problem*}

\vspace{0.5in}

Suppose $p(z)$ is the characteristic polynomial of $T.$

\begin{claim*}
$p(z)=(z-3)^a(z-5)^b(z-8)^c,$ where one of $a,b,c$ equals 2 and the others
equal 1.
\end{claim*}
\begin{proof}
Since each eigenvalue has multiplicity at least 1, and the sum of the
multiplicities is 4, we see that the multiplicities are 1, 1, 2.
\end{proof}

Suppose $q(z)=(z-3)^2(z-5)^2(z-8)^2.$

\begin{claim*}
    $q(z)$ is a multiple of the minimal polynomial.
\end{claim*}
\begin{proof}
By \textit{8.48}, we know that $p(z)$ is a multiple of the
minimal polynomial. Since $q(z)$ is a multiple of $p(z),$
it follows that $q(z)$ is a multiple of the minimal polynomial.
\end{proof}

Finally, by \textit{8.46}, $q(T)=0.$
